I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we've shared

It was awesome
But we lost it
It's not possible
For me not to care

And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change
Until you hear
My dear

The 7 things I hate about you
The 7 things I hate about you (oh you)

You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy

Your friends they're jerks
When you act like them
Just know it hurts

I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and silent
As I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now
Is your sincere apology

When you mean it
I'll believe it
If you text it
I'll delete it

Let's be clear
Oh I'm not coming back
You're taking 7 steps here

The 7 things I hate about you

You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy

Your friends they're jerks
When you act like them
Just know it hurts

I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The 7 that I like

The 7 things I like about you

Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy

Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined
Everything's alright

I want to be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you
You do

You don't understand what it is
That makes me tick
But you wish you did
You always second guess,wonder if i say yes
but you just lose out every time

If you only knew what i talked about
When I'm with my friends just hangin' out
Then you'd have the inside scoop
On what to say, what to do
That way when you play the game
Baby you could never lose

Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall
A creepy little sneaky little Fly on the Wall
All my precious secrets, yeah
You'd know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall

You'd love to know, the things I do
When I'm with my friends, and not with you
Your always second guess, wonder if
There's other guys im flirting with
You should know by now

If you were my boyfriend, I'd be true to you
If I make a promise, I'm comin' thru
Don't you wish that you could
See me every second of the day
That way you would have no doubt
That baby i would never stray

Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall
A creepy little sneaky little Fly on the Wall
All my precious secrets, yeah
You'd know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall

A little communication
Well that'll go a long way
You're getting misinformation
Too much hearsay, hearsay

and what i say is
come a little closer
And what I'm gonna say is

Don't You
Don't You
Don't You
Don't you wish you were a...
Hey!

Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall
A creepy little sneaky little Fly on the Wall
All my precious secrets, yeah
You'd know them all
Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall

I can honestly say
You've been on my mind
Since I woke up today
I look at your photograph all the time
These memories come back to life
And I don't mind

I remember when we kissed
I still feel it on my lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
I remember the simple things
I remember till I cry
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
The memory I wanna forget
Is goodbye

I woke up this morning
And played our song
And through my tears I sang along
I picked up the phone and then
Put it down
'cause I know I'm wasting my time
And I don't mind

I remember when we kissed
I still feel it on my lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
I remember the simple things
I remember till I cry
But the one thing I wish I'd forget
The memory I wanna forget

Suddenly my cell phone's blowing up
With your ring tone
I hesitate but answer it anyway
You sound so alone
And I'm surprised to hear you say

You remember when we kissed
You still feel it on your lips
The time that you danced with me
With no music playing
You remember the simple things
We talk till we cry
You said that your biggest regret
The one thing you wish I'd forget
Is saying goodbye

Saying goodbye
Oh, Goodbye

Do I suck dick? You ain't seen shit
Throw a C-note, watch it slide down my throat
Yeah, my pussy fine, I pop it 'cause it's mine
I don't give a fuck if they call me a slut
What I do with a dick, elect me Presidick
Put tears in his eyes when I milk a brother dry

So nasty

I'ma keep workin' from dawn to dusk
So I can keep buyin' cars off Elon Musk
The matte-black spinners, no that's a must
I want the whole pie, so leave the crust
I'm the moon, I'm the stars, I'm a Maserati
I love you, Nicki, but I listen to Cardi
I got a new song on the radio
And it goes five, four, three, two
One, that's right, it's a number one
And I can't take you with me as a carry-on
I already got my luggage, it's Margielan
And for my sixteenth birthday, I got Carey on
From the house of the queen

Queen, "Queen" is what you can call me
Queen, I'ma have you runnin' to your mommy
Queen, I'm the life of the party
Don't worry 'bout me, go and get yourself a hobby

I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)

And I say, oh (Oh)
The way I breathe you in (In)
It's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby
Never let you go, oh
And I say, oh
There's nothing like your touch

And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time

I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)

You ain't sure yet
But I'm for ya
All I can want, all I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There's no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I'm in Mallorca
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn't hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa

I got my peaches out in Georgia (Oh, yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (That's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (Yeah, that's it)

Everybody knows my name now
But something 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seeing somebody else

And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killing me now

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fucking lonely

I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did
As an idiot kid

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me

'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fucking lonely

I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
